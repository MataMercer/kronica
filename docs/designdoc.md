# WikiApp

# Description
A website that helps artists communicate a world to an audience as well 
as provide organization tools for world building.

# How it solves the problem
A big problem artists have on Twitter is posting their original characters (OCs)
and the audience not knowing the context behind the character. This restricts the 
artist into delivering only art that can only be enjoyed with limited context.

This website solves it
by letting the author attach characters to the post. If the audience wants to find
out more about the characters, they can click on links on the side, bringing up a
wiki page. The wiki page can be contributed by the audience. These character and
setting pages make up a "World".

Furthermore, the author can build timelines through their posts. The artist can upload
and insert their upload chronologically among their other uploads. Also, the artist
can link or "reply" left, down, or right. This builds an alternative timeline.
