#Configuring Kronikart

# Intro
Configuring is done through the config file, command arguments, .env files, or the web interface. The order of least to most precedence is the command arguments, config file, and .env file. Both config, .env and the config file, have the most precedence
because the admin can edit these as they please.


# Configuring .env file
The env file can be used for configuring sensitive information. It is done by creating a .env file in the repository's root directory.
